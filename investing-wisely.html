           <h2>Should I invest in crypto?</h2>
            <p>That is a very hot question. Although cryptocurrencies have made enormous gains in recent months, they are collectively still considered to be extremely risky investments. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/091013/future-cryptocurrency.asp">Investopedia</a> has some great content on this topic worth sharing:</p>
            <p><i>If you are considering investing in cryptocurrencies, it may be best to treat your “investment” in the same way you would treat any other highly speculative venture. In other words, recognize that you run the risk of losing most of your investment, if not all of it... a cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value apart from what a buyer is willing to pay for it at a point in time. This makes it very susceptible to huge price swings, which in turn increases the risk of loss for an investor. Bitcoin, for example, plunged from $260 to about $130 within a six-hour period on April 11, 2013. If you cannot stomach that kind of volatility, look elsewhere for investments that are better suited to you. While opinion continues to be deeply divided about the merits of Bitcoin as an investment – supporters point to its limited supply and growing usage as value drivers, while detractors see it as just another speculative bubble – this is one debate that a conservative investor would do well to avoid.</i>

            <h2>Should I use my credit card to invest in crypto?</h2>
            <p>Now this question is a much easier one to answer – <b>no</b>. Firstly, if you are going to be investing at all, we recommend using the <a target="_blank" href="https://gdax.com">GDAX website</a>, not the Coinbase mobile app. You will pay far less in fees and have many more tools at your disposal to make intelligent investment decisions. Beyond that, cryptocurrency is not a safe investment, and going into debt in order to "gamble" on cryptocurrency is a recipe for disaster.</p>
            <h2>Should I invest in Bitcoin or lesser-known altcoins?</h2>
            <p>Your guess is as good as anyone else's, but make sure to do research on any coin before considering making an investment. ICOs (initial coin offerings) are becoming increasingly common, and there is significant risk associated with investing in altcoins with very small market capitalizations, as there is with all cryptocurrencies.</p>
