# SimpleTicker
SimpleTicker is a tool to view real-time data from the Coinbase (GDAX) exchange, including current and historical price data on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. We are not affiliated with Coinbase.

We felt like there needed to be a simple interface for the average user to easily digest price data, rather than another super-cool looking dashboard cluttered with unnecessary information. So, we created SimpleTicker.
